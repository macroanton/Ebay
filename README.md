The ebay-dl.py file scrapes ebay for a given search and compiles valued information

To run this, in ebay-dl.py, command line would look like 'python3 ebay-dl.py 'search-term''
For my search terms, the following command lines would yield the same json files:
python3 ebay-dl.py 'chess'
python3 ebay-dl.py 'cruiser motorcycle'
python3 ebay-dl.py 'neon sign'
